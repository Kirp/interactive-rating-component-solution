## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension


### What I learned

On this one I tried out using SASS and it really did make things easier. Also I feel like my js code is not that clean yet when working with DOM objects.
